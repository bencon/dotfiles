# dotfiles

Managed with stow, influenced by https://github.com/xero/dotfiles

By default the stow command will create symlinks for files in the parent directory of where you execute the command. My dotfiles setup assumes this repo is located in the root directory (~/dotfiles). All stow commands should be executed from that directory (~/dotfiles).
